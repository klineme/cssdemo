Core Java!!!!!!!!!!!!:

- Programming platform
    Web app
    standalone
- Enterprise Systems
- Fast, Reliable, secure
- ADVANTAGES:
    -JVM Java virtual machine
    -Run anywhere
- Regular Updates
- 99% Object oriented
    - Primatives
- Easy to use and learn

OOP: Describe each pillar without defining another one
    Polymorphism: Objects and Methods in java can take different forms during different stages of execution
        interface Runnable{}
        class job implements Runnable{}
        Job J= new Job();
        Runnable R = new Job();
    Encapsulation: Hiding data
    Abstraction: Practice of hiding complexity through public API
        - Public API exposure through
            -interface
            -abstract class
    Inheritance:
        -Gaining state or behavior from superclass or interface
        - Inherited state
        - inherited behavior

Class vs Object
    -Class is a blueprint, object is an instance
    - OBJECT: INVOKE BEHAVIOR (new())

Outerclass: File with class in it
Inner Class: Class you define inside the outer class, inner class can use all of outer class.. But outer class may not be able to use inner

Shadowing is when a local scope variable overrides a higher scope

Go over scopes, also go over order of scopes:
    -Class
    -instance
    -Method
    -Parameter
    -Block
    -Local - Always taks precedence

Control Statements in java
    Logic Control if, else, switch
    Loop Control
