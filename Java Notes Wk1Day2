Varargs:
    -Array of unknown size in method argument list
    -Must be last argument in list

While loops for indeterminant

for(String n : s) n being the current element, s being the iterable collection

Strings:

    -Object that represents collection of characters
    -Immutable
    -Strings created by literals stored in string pool
    -Strings created using new keyword are stored in normal heap segment (Not reccomended)
    -String pool reuses strings (internalizing strings)

    -Sringbuffer is synchronized
    -add new methods to the string api

Wrapper Classes

STACK TRACE

finally block -- interview


Garbage Collection
    - Remove objects from heap that no longer have any stack references
    -Long running process (daemon thread)
    - Starts when thhe first user thread is started by jvm
    -Terminated when the last user thread terminates

Types of Garbage Collectors: -Not suitable for server
    -Serial Garbage COllector
        -Freezes all user threads
        -Scans each thread head sequentially
    -Parallel Garbage COllector:
        - Freezes too, but instead of sequentially, all in parallel
    -Concurrent Mark Sweep Garbage Collector
    -G1 Garbage Collector
