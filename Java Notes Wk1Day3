OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
    -Polymorphism
        - Objects and methods in java can take different forms during stages of execution
        - Method Overloading
        - Method overriding
        - covariance
            - subclass
    -Encapsulation
        -Typically said data hiding
        -Private/protected data fields
        -public getters setters
    -Abstraction
        -Hiding complexity
            -Public API exposure
            - Interface
            - Abstract class
    -Inheritance
        -Means of gaining state or behavior from superclass
            -Or interface
        -Inherited state
        -Inherited Behavior
        -Can't inherit private stuff?
        -Implicitly the first line in any constructor is the super

    -INTERFACES
        -Usually X-able
        -Define behavior
        -First non abstract class needs to implemment all abstract methods
        -public
        -Default keyword - java 8 feature

    CASTING Objects
        -Down casting is implicit (can always cast down)

    Deadly Diamond - look up

    SERIALIZATION
        -Mechanism for writing object state to a byte stream

        iInvalidClassException - serialVersionUID mismatch
        NotserializableException - Class is not serializable
        ClassNotFoundException - When reading, suitable class not found
        -When serializing when an exception occurs all serialization is rolled back and the exception is written to file
        public class whatever implements Serializable
        -transient blocks serialization

    COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK - Understand Differences (methods and stuff)
        -Iterable vs Inumerable
            Iterable- compare/find by actual object
            Inumerable- compare/find by a different value
    GENERICS -- look it up

    -HASHCODE AND EQUALS
        -If you override equals you should override hashcode (vice versa)
        -Comes from object class
        Hashcode- Takes memory address and maps to int
        Equals - compares memory location of two objects
        - The Contract for collections
        -Don't forget rules
    -COMPARING OBJECTS -- NOT IN SLIDES
        -Comparable
            this is comparable to that
                -CompareTo
            natural ordering (A-z)(0-infinity)
        -Comparator
            -This operator compares
                -compare
