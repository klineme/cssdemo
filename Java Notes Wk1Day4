Static blocks:
    -Drivers


Class Builder:
    -Execute from top down
        -Object gets created first (although static variables and static blocks really first)
        -Constructor is last thing to run when creating classes

Functional Programming Language
    -Relies on functions to do everything
    -Closure
        Scopes within scopes
        -Allowing scope of inner function to keep scope of outer function
    -Lambdas apparently
    -Self invocation
Lambdas
    -Basically changes very rapidly and doesn't have any binding ties
    -Defining function in place
    -ex: function(function(){})
    -not:
    var z = function(){}
    function(z);
    -In java: Anonymous Class, functional interfaces
    ex:
    Collections.sort(ints, (a, b) ->{
        //Can just build a compare function
    })
    Good for instances when you don't need to reuse functionality

Streams
    Sequential - Item 1 to item N, straight order
    Parallel - Breaks up collection somehow
    Look up function interface

Threads -- LOOK AT PPT
    -Atomic Operations

    how to:
        Extend Thread, must override run
        Implement Runnable, must override run
        Memorize Thread States
