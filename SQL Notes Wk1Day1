Database: Collection of database
-How do we store data?
    -Columns and Rows
        -Each row is an entry in table
    Example: Customer table, employee table. Relate to Object
        Customer: ID, name, purchase
-Sublanguages:
    -DML - INsert, Update, Delete
    -DQL - Select -- Can be considered DML (Select * selects all columns)
    -DDL - Create, Alter, Truncate, Drop - Drop destroys entire table, truncate removes all record but table in tact
    -DLL - grant, revoke
    -TCL - commit, rollback, savepoint
    -Oracle SE2 free usage tier

        Normalization:
            1NF -- The Key, Can't have a column with mutliple data
            2NF -- Only the key, Everything in your table should depend on composite key
            3NF -- NOthing but they key, transative functional dependencies
    -Reverenial Integrity?!

    -Group by function
    -Order by

    -Scalar Function: Each row individually, sin() log() abs() .. Look for string stuff
    -Aggregate function: multiple rows : Sum()
