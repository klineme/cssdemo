events:

elem.addeventlistener(string, fn(){})
 ex:

btn.addeventlistener("click", fn(event){
    event.preventDefault();
    var x = event.target; -> Will return target if there were multiples
}
event bubbling: when the parent captures the event rather than the child
HOISTING!@?!@!?@?!@!@!@!?@?
var i = 1;

fn(){
    var i = 2; LOCAL TO THIS FUNCTION
    c.log(i);
}

vvvv

fn(){
    c.log(i); i is undefined because it's being HOISTED, being declated before
    var i = 2;
}
